  <h1 class="mb-4">Who We Are</h1>

  <p>VISION is not just a brand – it’s a movement. A creative force born out of the desire to break limits, challenge norms, and redefine what fashion can mean.</p>

  <p>We exist for the bold – the ones who refuse to blend in, who wear their truth with pride, and who know that style is not just what you wear, but how you carry your story.</p>

  <p>We started as just two people in a small room with big ideas — no funding, no hype, just vision and drive. What began with late nights, hand-packed orders, and a few loyal supporters slowly grew into something real.</p>

  <p>As the message spread, so did the movement. From 2 to 5, then 10 team members — designers, creators, and dreamers — each one bringing their energy and passion to the table. That’s when VISION started to feel legit. Not because of numbers, but because people started believing in what we stood for.</p>

  <p>Founded with a deep respect for authenticity and expression, VISION is where streetwear meets purpose, minimalism meets rebellion, and every thread is woven with meaning. Our collections are designed to speak without words – clean cuts, strong lines, and subtle details that reflect the strength of individuality.</p>

  <p>We are inspired by youth culture, art, resistance, and the beauty of contrast – tradition and innovation, raw and refined, local and global. Each piece is a reflection of who we are and who we dare to become.</p>

  <p>We believe in slow fashion, in creating with intention. We don’t chase trends – we chase truth. Every drop is curated with care, ethically sourced, and built to last – because a real vision has no expiration date.</p>

  <p>Whether you wear VISION on the streets, on the stage, or in the mirror – know this:<br>
  You are not just wearing clothes. You’re wearing a message. A mindset. A manifesto.</p>

  <h2 class="mt-4">Welcome to VISION.<br>Wear what you stand for.</h2>
